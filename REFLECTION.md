### What made your assistant "personal" to you?

My assistant felt personal because I have been wanting to make a little rasberry pi operated virtual assistant , with predetermined responses and a backstory connected to Star Wars OC Prop as a side project. I took this oppurtunity to take the first step and have fun at an early time before diving full into it , making the assitant record my tasks and have its "mood" change as I completed them was fun. 

### What challenges did you face using this?

The main challenge was simply getting the code to work correctly and output exactly what I wanted without errors. This involved making sure all the parts of the (object) were set up right and that the actions performed as expected. While making sure  the (this) keyword was part of this process, the larger struggle was debugging and making the entire program run smoothly.

### Which method would you improve or expand?

I would improve the (completeTask) method. Right now, it only removes the first task from the list. I would expand it so I could choose to complete any task by its name, or multiple ones not just the one at the top. This would give me more control over my task list.
